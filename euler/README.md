# Euler's Method

Eulers method is a way to approximate general solutions to first-order differential equations.
This script in Python will computer the approximate curve based on the step size, the initial point,
and the final point.

**For students who want to use the code for calculations here are the instructions needed to use it**

1. Make sure you have Python 2 or 3 installed https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Make sure you have an IDE or text editor you can use(typically Pycharm or VSCode)
3. If you want to pull the code from GitHub, make sure you have Git installed then do git clone ______ or you can copy and paste the code
4. Open up a terminal by searching for it on your laptop, do  ⇧ Shift+⌘+U if you are on Mac, or search up command prompt on Windows
5. Type pip install numpy into the terminal and press enter
6. Type pip install matplotlib into the terminal and press enter
7. Open the eulers.py file on your text editor or IDE
8. *Change the directory of your terminal by typing cd directory_name and pressing enter to where eulers.py is*
9. Look for the dy_dx variable: that is the differential equation you will use for whatever problem
10. Modify the differential equation if needed in terms of x0 and y_m
11. Save the file and click run on your IDE or type python eulers.py in the terminal 
12. The program will ask for an x0, y0, point of approximation, and step size. Make sure you enter the values that are given in the problem.
13. A plot should be generated similar to the image below and the approximate points will be printed out in the output

**Here are some common functions that you will be using**
1. np.sin(x0) is sine
2. np.cos(x0) is cosine
3. np.tan(x0) is tangent
4. np.exp(x0) is e
5. np.arcsin(x0) is arcsine
6. np.arctan(x0) is arctangent
7. np.arccos(x0) is arccosine
8. np.log(x0) is ln
9. np.log10(x0) is log 10
